NMDC
----
The National Microbiome Data Collaborative (NMDC) is a new initiative, launched in July 2019 and funded by the Department of Energyâ€™s (DOE) Office of Science, Biological and Environmental Research program, that aims to empower the research community to more effectively harness microbiome data. The NMDC is building an open-source, integrated data science ecosystem aimed at leveraging existing efforts in the microbiome research space, including data standards, quality, integration, and access, to create a linked data discovery portal. Read the Nature Reviews Microbiology Comment on the NMDC or visit microbiomedata.org.
